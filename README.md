# 🚀 Installation

## 1. Download SahtoutCMS V2

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/blodyiheb/SahtoutCMS.git
```

Or download the repository as a ZIP from GitHub.

> **Important:** The `main` branch contains the current SahtoutCMS V2 release.
# 📦 Dependencies

```bash
composer install
npm install
npm run build
```
---

# 🪟 2. Windows / XAMPP Installation

Extract SahtoutCMS into:

```text
C:\xampp\htdocs\
```

The project root should look similar to:

### ✅ Correct

```text
C:\xampp\htdocs\
├── admin/
├── assets/
├── includes/
├── install/
├── index.php
└── ...
```

### ❌ Incorrect

```text
C:\xampp\htdocs\sahtout\sahtout\
```

Make sure the project is not unnecessarily nested inside another directory.

Start:

* Apache
* MySQL / MariaDB

from the XAMPP Control Panel.

> XAMPP is optional and is mainly recommended for local Windows development.

---

# 🐧 3. Linux / Apache Installation

Extract SahtoutCMS into your Apache document root.

A common location is:

```text
/var/www/html/
```

For example:

```text
/var/www/html/
├── admin/
├── assets/
├── includes/
├── install/
├── index.php
└── ...
```

If your Apache configuration uses another document root, place SahtoutCMS inside that directory.

Make sure Apache has permission to read and execute the required project files.

---

# 🗄️ Database Setup

Before running the installer, make sure your **AzerothCore databases are already installed and working**.

SahtoutCMS uses its own website database and connects to the AzerothCore databases.

## Website Database

Import sahtout_site SQL file.

## AzerothCore Databases

Import the required additional SQL files into their corresponding AzerothCore databases.

For example:

```text
acore_auth_sahtout_site.sql
→ acore_auth

acore_world_armory_spell.sql
→ acore_world
```

> ⚠️ SQL filenames and database requirements may change between releases. Always check the SQL files included with the version you are installing.

Make sure the required databases exist before continuing with the installer.

---

# 🔧 Web Installer

After preparing the project files and databases, open the installer in your browser.

## XAMPP / Local Development

```text
http://localhost/install/
```

## Production Server

```text
http(s)://your-domain.com/install/
```

Replace `your-domain.com` with your actual domain.

The installer will guide you through the required configuration.

---

# ⚙️ Installer Configuration

Depending on the version, the installer may configure:

* Website database
* AzerothCore database connections
* Realm information
* SMTP / email
* reCAPTCHA
* SOAP
* Website settings

Make sure all database credentials and AzerothCore connection information are correct.

---

```text
install/
```

This helps prevent unauthorized access to the installation system.
